# Official Rules of Tennis Polo (Toccer)

## Objective

The primary aim of Tennis Polo, also known as Toccer, is for one team to score more goals than the opposing team within the allotted time.

## Equipment

### Ball
Standard tennis balls are used for play.

### Racquets
Only the racket keeper is allowed to use a tennis racquet.

### Goal
Dimensions and specifications can be similar to a standard soccer or field hockey goal, adjusted to suit the play style of Tennis Polo (Toccer).

## Teams

Each team consists of 10 players: 9 field players and 1 racket keeper.

## Scoring

- A goal is scored when the ball is either thrown or kicked past the goal line and into the net, defended by the racket keeper.
- A goal from within the 17-yard semi-circular line (2-pt line) is worth one point.
- A goal from outside the 2-pt line is worth two points.

## Field of Play Markings

### Layer
The goal area is marked by a box extending 6 yards from the goal line and 20 yards across (similar to a soccer goalie box), contiguous with a semi-circular line of a radius extending 11 yards from the center of the goal line.

### 2-point Line
A semi-circular line with a radius of 23.75 yards (almost 22 meters) from the center of the goal line, marking the area from which successful goals are awarded two points.

## Offside Rule

Players from the team without ball possession cannot advance past the last defender of the opposing team (excluding the racket keeper).

## Racket Keeper (Goalkeeper) Rules

- The racket keeper is the only player permitted to use a racket.
- The racket keeper must stay within the layer if they have their racket.
- The racket keeper can leave the layer without their racket or can be substituted at any given time.

## Match Duration

Standard tournament matches last 40 minutes, split into two halves of 20 minutes each. There's a 10-minute break in between halves.

## Touchoff

A game begins with a touchoff, where the racket keeper hits the ball to opposing side of the field. Defensive players cannot cross midfield until an offensive player makes contact with the ball; failure to adhere results in a zone violation penalty.

## Ball Out of Play

The ball is considered out of play when it crosses the boundary lines of the field, either on the ground or in the air, or when play is stopped by the referee.

## Tiebreak Mechanism

In the event of a tie, an extra time period is played. If the tie persists, penalty throws from the penalty spot determine the winner.

## Shot Clock Rule

A 30-second shot clock is used to maintain a steady game pace. The offensive team must attempt a shot on goal within 30 seconds of gaining possession. Failure to do so results in a turnover.

## 10-Second Rule

Players with ball possession are limited to 10 seconds to either:
- Pass the ball to a teammate, or
- Attempt a shot on goal.

Exceeding the 10-second limit results in a turnover.

## Free Possessions on Interceptions

If a defensive player intercepts a pass, the 10-second rule is suspended for the duration of that possession. The free possession concludes when:
- The intercepting team loses ball possession immediately after the interception.
- The ball reverts to the defensive zone (home zone of the intercepting team).

## Substitution

Tennis Polo (Toccer) allows live substitutions. Players can be substituted in and out during active play without notifying the referee.

## Infractions

### Penalty Duration
Penalties resulting in a power-play last for a duration of 2 minutes or until a goal is scored by the team with the numerical advantage, whichever comes first. If a goal is scored before the 2-minute penalty duration has expired, the penalized player may re-enter the field, and teams return to full strength.

### Penalty Throws
Penalty throws occur from a designated penalty spot, taken by a single attacking player against the racket keeper. The chosen player must throw the ball with the intent to score, while the racket keeper attempts to prevent the ball from entering the goal. All other players must remain outside the penalty area until the ball is thrown.

Penalty throws are awarded for specific infractions as outlined in the rules, or as a tiebreak mechanism following a tied match after extra time.

### Types of Infractions
- **Unsportsmanlike Conduct**: Disrespectful behavior towards officials, opponents, spectators.
- **Excessive Fouling**: Accumulating a certain number of personal fouls.
- **Delay of Game**: Deliberate actions to slow down the game contrary to the spirit of the rules.
- **Illegal Substitution**: Incorrect substitution procedures.
- **Too Many Players on the Field**: Having more than the allowed number of players on the field.
- **Intentional Misconduct**: Intentionally breaking the rules to gain an advantage.

## Historical Background

In 2004, the Tennis Director at Camp Awosting in Lakeside, Connecticut, Ron Bronson, created the sport of toccer as a diversion for his tennis players during a rainy summer. The outdoor tennis courts were largely unusable, so Bronson came up with a series of elaborate tennis hybrid games that could be played indoors or on grass fields. The most popular of these games was toccer, which is a combination of tennis and soccer.

At the insistence of his campers and with their help, Bronson devised the first written rules of the sport later that summer.

In 2010, the rules were modified dramatically at Windridge Camp at Teela-Wooket in Roxbury, Vermont. Players there discovered the sport and modified the rules to allow only goalkeepers to carry rackets. In this modified format, field players advance the ball by throwing it across the field (and into the goal.) After a year of experimental rules testing, the governing body of Tennis Polo, the Tennis Polo Players Association (TPPA), codified the Vermont format as the official format of toccer.
